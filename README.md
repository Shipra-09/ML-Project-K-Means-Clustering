#  K-means Clustering Project 
***

### Projects:

Project: To identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.


### Objectives:

Exploring Insights/Inferences by performing EDA on the given data. Relevant graphs were plotted to get some insights on data using seaborn package. Model fitting via K-means Clustering by Importing sklearn package. 
***

### Python Libraries Used:
   * Pandas
   * Numpy
   * Matplotlib
   * Seaborn
   * Scikit learn
   * Joblib

***

### Methodology:
 1. Data copying and cleaning:
    * Read the csv file
    * copy the data
    * check for null values and other informations
    * drop the duplicate values
 
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    * Conduct all the necessary EDA using various graphs on the dataset
    * interpret the graphs
    * check for outliers and correlation among the coloumns
    * perform one hot encoding in case of categorical columns

 3. Sampling of data:
    * Scaling the data using StandardScaler and Normalizer

 4. Modelling of data:
     * import K-means clustering and initialize it
     * determine the k value using elbow method
     * fit the model
     * predict the model
